# alarm
Dart console application for an alarm reminder
This program allows users to set alarms with custom messages and receive reminders when the alarm time is reached.
This Dart program allows users to set alarms by inputting the time in HH:MM format. Once an alarm is set, the program will notify the user when the specified time is reached by printing a message to the console. The program will continue running until the user types "exit" to quit.
